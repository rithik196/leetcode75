Hint
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r







class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
          String word3 ="";
int l1 = word1.length();
int l2 = word2.length();


     int i =0;
     while(i<l1 || i<l2)
     {
        if(i<l1){
             word3+=""+ word1.charAt(i) ;

        }
        if(i<l2){
                word3+=""+word2.charAt(i);
        }
        i++;

     }
     return word3;
    }
}
